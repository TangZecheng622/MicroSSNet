\usage{
ssn_pipeline(
  table1,
  group_df = NULL,
  vscol1,
  vscol2,
  ssn_method = "SSN",
  control = "control",
  top = 0,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{table1}{Data frame containing species abundance data (rows as species, columns as samples).}

\item{group_df}{Optional data frame containing sample grouping information. Must include columns specified in \code{vscol1} and \code{vscol2}.}

\item{vscol1}{Character string specifying the column name in \code{group_df} that indicates the primary group labels.}

\item{vscol2}{Character string specifying the column name in \code{group_df} that indicates the secondary group labels.}

\item{ssn_method}{Character string specifying the method for single-sample network construction. Options are "SSN" or "Lioness". Default is "SSN".}

\item{control}{Character string specifying the control group name in \code{group_df}. Used when \code{ssn_method} is "SSN". Default is "control".}

\item{top}{Numeric value specifying the number of top edges to select. If \code{top > 0}, selects top \code{top} edges based on weight. Default is 0 (no filtering).}

\item{pvl_threshold}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 for prevalence threshold in filtering species. Default is 0.5.}

\item{r_threshold}{Numeric value for the correlation coefficient threshold. Edges with absolute correlation below this value will be removed. Default is 0.3.}

\item{scale}{Logical value indicating whether to scale network weights to the range . Default is TRUE.}

\item{save}{Logical value indicating whether to save the outputs to files. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
The function outputs various files and plots in the \verb{./ssn/} directory.
}
\description{
This function performs network construction and analysis for single-sample networks based on microbial abundance data.
